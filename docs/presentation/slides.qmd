Factor Fund
Factor-based & ML-driven Equity Strategy

A modular, production-style pipeline combining:

Factor investing

Machine learning

Portfolio optimization

Clean documentation

All datasets shown in this public version are synthetic or anonymized.

Motivation

Why combine factor models with machine learning?

Markets are noisy and dynamic

Linear models can under-express nonlinear relationships

Factors bring economic intuition

ML brings flexible predictive power

Together they create a robust, interpretable, and adaptive strategy

High-Level Architecture

We organize the pipeline into five modules (M1–M5):

M1 — Data Preparation
M2 — Prediction Model
M3 — Portfolio Construction
M4 — Backtesting & Performance
M5 — Factor Analysis


This structure mirrors real-world quant research pipelines,
while remaining simple and teachable in a public repo.

Module M1 — Data Preparation
Objective

Build a clean factor matrix for model consumption.

Steps

Load synthetic or anonymized raw data

Build factor features:

Value, Momentum, Quality

Size, Volatility

Apply:

Normalization

Winsorization

Ranking

Output

A table with:

date, ticker, factor_1, factor_2, ..., factor_n

Module M2 — Prediction Model
Objective

Predict relative performance across the cross-section.

Models supported

Ridge / Lasso

RandomForest / XGBoost

Neural networks (Keras/TensorFlow)

Workflow

Rolling training on historical factor matrices

Model persistence (.keras or .pkl)

Daily inference producing model scores

Output
date, ticker, model_score

Module M3 — Portfolio Construction
Objective

Translate model scores into daily positions.

Approach

Ranking or quantile bucketing

Optional constraints:

Long-only or long/short

Max/min weights

Turnover limits

Sector balancing (optional)

Output
date, ticker, target_weight


Used for either simulation (M4) or actual daily implementation (internal).

Module M4 — Backtesting & Performance
Computes

Daily PnL

Benchmark-relative performance

Annualized volatility

Sharpe, Sortino

Max drawdown

(% of CDI for Brazilian benchmark cases)

Produces

Return curves

Distribution plots

Drawdown charts

Stored under:

reports/figures/

Module M5 — Factor Analysis
Three pillars:
1. Factor Importance

SHAP values

Permutation importance

Cross-sectional contributions

2. Factor Exposures

Regression of portfolio returns on factor returns

Understanding unintended bets

3. Factor Premia

Future returns of “high minus low” factor portfolios

Regime-based analysis

End-to-End Flow
Raw synthetic data
       ↓
M1 – Data preparation → factor matrix
       ↓
M2 – Model training & inference → scores
       ↓
M3 – Portfolio construction → target weights
       ↓
M4 – Backtesting → performance analytics
       ↓
M5 – Factor analysis → interpretability

Reproducibility

The repository includes:

The full M1–M5 skeleton

Example synthetic datasets

Demonstration notebooks

A clean project layout for hiring managers or collaborators

Roadmap

Short term:

Add synthetic end-to-end example

Include SHAP visualizations

Add factor exposure calculations

Add simple automated tests

Medium term:

Add L/S strategy demo

Add alternative factor definitions

Add multi-country universe option
