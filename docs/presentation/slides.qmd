## Factor Fund

### Systematic Factor & Machine Learning Strategy

A modular research pipeline combining:

- Factor investing  
- Machine learning  
- Portfolio optimization  
- Clean documentation  

All datasets shown in this public version are **synthetic or anonymized**.

---

## Why this project exists

- Markets are noisy, nonlinear and regime-dependent  
- Traditional factor models provide **economic intuition**
- Machine learning provides **predictive flexibility**
- Combining both yields:  
  - Robustness  
  - Interpretability  
  - Adaptability  

Goal: demonstrate a **real-world quant pipeline** in a clean public format.

---

## High-Level Architecture

The pipeline is structured into **five modules (M1–M5)**:

```
M1 — Data Preparation
M2 — Prediction Model
M3 — Portfolio Construction
M4 — Backtesting & Performance
M5 — Factor Analysis
```

This mirrors professional quant research environments while remaining readable.

---

## Module M1 — Data Preparation

### Objective
Build a **clean factor matrix** ready for modeling.

### Steps
- Synthetic/anonymized raw data  
- Feature engineering (Value, Momentum, Quality, Size, Volatility)  
- Normalization  
- Winsorization  
- Ranking  

### Output
```
date, ticker, factor_1, factor_2, ..., factor_n
```

---

## Module M2 — Prediction Model

### Objective
Predict **future cross-sectional performance**.

### Supported models
- Ridge / Lasso  
- RandomForest / XGBoost  
- Neural networks (Keras/TensorFlow)

### Workflow
1. Historical rolling training  
2. Model saved to disk  
3. Daily inference returning **model scores**

### Output
```
date, ticker, model_score
```

---

## Module M3 — Portfolio Construction

### Objective
Turn model scores into implementable positions.

### Steps
- Ranking or bucketing  
- Normalization of weights  
- Optional constraints:
  - Long-only or long/short  
  - Max/min weights  
  - Turnover limits  
  - Sector balancing  

### Output
```
date, ticker, target_weight
```

Usable for simulation (M4) or real implementation.

---

## Module M4 — Backtesting & Performance

### Metrics computed
- Daily PnL  
- Benchmark vs. strategy  
- Annualized volatility  
- Sharpe & Sortino  
- Max drawdown  
- (% of CDI for Brazilian context)

### Visual outputs
- Return curves  
- Drawdown chart  
- Distribution of returns  

Stored under:

```
reports/figures/
```

---

## Module M5 — Factor Analysis

### Includes

#### 1) Factor Importance
- SHAP values  
- Permutation importance  
- Model-based decomposition  

#### 2) Factor Exposures  
- Portfolio betas vs factor returns  
- Identify unintended bets

#### 3) Factor Premia  
- Future returns of factors  
- Regime-based performance

Factor analysis provides **interpretability + economic context**.

## End-to-End Flow

```
Raw synthetic data
       ↓
M1 – Data Preparation → factor matrix
       ↓
M2 – Prediction Model → scores
       ↓
M3 – Portfolio Construction → weights
       ↓
M4 – Backtesting → performance analytics
       ↓
M5 – Factor Analysis → interpretability
```

## Reproducibility

This repository includes:

- Full M1–M5 project structure  
- Synthetic datasets  
- Notebooks illustrating each module  
- Clean and professional documentation  

Designed as a **public quant research showcase**.

---

## Roadmap

**Short term**
- Add synthetic end-to-end example  
- Include SHAP/importance visuals  
- Add factor exposure analysis  
- Add simple automated tests  

**Medium term**
- Add long/short example  
- Add alternative factors  
- Add multi-country universe
